8et all clocks and timepieces ahead
One hour Just before retiring Saturday
night.
Those who are awake at 2 a. m.,
Sunday, may wait until that hour to
set their timepieces ahead one hour.
Ahead—-forward—one hour. Under
stand this and do it, and having done
it, be content, nor worry any more
about it.
This simple Instruction, obeyed so
thoroughly that every timepiece in
the oountry la thus changed one hour
ahead, will carry out the law and pre
vent any confusion whatever. Every
phase of life will move ahead with the
cloaks—trains, street cars, business,
religious services—everything. The 9
o'clock trains Sunday morning will
leave at 9 o'clock by the clock. The 7
o'clock atreet cars will run at 7 o'clock
by the clock—everything will be Juet I
as it Is now, by the clock. And the riotic
clock will be the only thing to rely on
as
It Is now. Just what!his
the clock says, after It has been turned
ahead one hour, that will be the time,
and the time for everything, Just as It
is now. There will be no change in
anything except the clocks and
watches, and no one need pay any at
tention to the fact that they have been
moved one hour ahead.
Complete plans for the daylight sav
ing system, which' goes into effect to
morrow have been announced by fed
eral officials and the nation's workers
are ready to push the hands of the
•clock one hour ahead to assist Uncle
Sam In hig fight for liberty.
Every city in the country, every
town and village, everything is in
readiness for the new system, a sys
tem that will save the nation thou
sands of tons of coal daily as well as
assisting the working man, the shop
girl and the laboring clasa as well as
the busy office man.
What this plan means to the nation
can be described in a few words. In
the first place It means the conserva
tion of the fuel supply. Secondly,-it
gives the average man more time to
devote to gardening, which In turn
means a "bigger supply of food for the
nation and, thirdly, it means a more
healthy nation.
The work of the masses will be done
In daylight, where, heretofore, it was
done In the dark a certain number of
hours a day.
Favored by All.
Since the plan was first spoken of
it has attracted the attention of some
of the biggest men in the country.
Efficiency experts have studied the
plans and in very instance have re
turned a favorable report on their
study.
The action has been favored by
President Wilson for the past several
months. Garfield and Hoover have
been ardent supporters of the plan.
There has never been an argument
against the system and every learned
man in the country is of the J.rsllef that
the plan will greatly aid the nation's
savings.
The daylight saving plan will give
the following daily advantages:
One hour or more for outdoor rec
reation. Recreation is a national as
set, an immense force for health and
moral well-being.
Working mothers and fathers obtain
an extra hour for outdoor play with
their children, both summer and win
ter.
One hour less for bad lights in tene
ments.
Lessened eyestrain for workers and
school children due to the use of artifi
cial light.
Smaller risk of accident in indus
trial establishments, because there
jwill he a light hour instead of a dark
one at the end of the working day at
,tlie time of greatest fati-gue and most
{frequent accidents.
Lessened risk of accidents due to
I transportation and traffic conditions,
because the afternoon rush will fall in
iduylight Instead of darkness,
Working girls will be on the way
home in the daylight instead of in the
!dark in winter.
Our last hour of sleep will be sound
ier and more 'beneficial than it is un
der present conditions, because there
will be less light.
General efficiency will, of course, be
•increased by any improvement in the
(health morals and social welfare of
tiie workers and others.
Morning Coolness.
I In summer a cool hour In the morn
jing is substituted for a hot one In
I the afternoon.
I In winter a light hour at the end of
the day is substituted for a dark one.
This is especially valuable com^g as
it does at the time of greatest fatigue,
and is peculiarly valuable in some in
dustries where aocurate eyesight is
essential.
Efficiency is lowest in the later aft
ernoon, the time when- accidents are
roost frequent.
There will be the greatest of all sav
ings—that of hnman materials, as
pointed out above.
Immediate saving in form of reduc
tion of expense for light and heat.
Ultimate saving in the conservation

        <text>Daylight Saving Is Simplicity Itself
How Ben Franklin s Idea Conceived in 1784, Just Made Into Law Here, Will Affect
Folks After Easter and Save Millions to the Nation
10
By WM. ARCHIBALD FERGUSON,
Secretary of the National Daylight Sar
ins Association.
ON Ihc coming Apwl 1 more people
in the United Slates will probably
be April fool vietims than on any previ
ous or future April 1, for Congress lias
decreed that at 2 o'clock on the morning
of March 31 the hands of the clock shall
be turned forward one hour; in other
words, the United States will then begin
to live under the davlight saving plan,
and doubtless thousands will forget to
make the change.
Every individual who is wise Jind hates
to be fooled will before retiring on the
evening prior to Kaster Sunday, March
31, see to it that not onh his watch but
every clock in the bou.se is turned for
ward one hour. Otherwise on Sunday he
will find the Easter services half over be
fore he arrives at the church, and on
Monday morning, April 1, VMS, rising
an hour late, if he is a commuter he will
miss his morning train by an hour and
be greeted at the factory or office with
such remarks as "April fool!" "You day
light blacker! You forgot to turn your
watch ahead, eh 7'' and all day long he
will be the butt of many jokes.
May Wait Lone for Dinner.
If lie starts for home at the tame hour
as usual and has not during the day tele
phoned his wife to turn the clock ahead
be will have a long wail tor dinner. One
thing Is certain, hotvivcr. that before he
retires that night crry member of his
household will know that the daylight pav
ing plan is in effect and that the people
of the United States are living an hour
ahead of sun time.
The daylight sating idea U almost as
Id as the United States it-elf and our
country can rightly claim the credit for
all the many advantages which will act-rue
from it, not only in this country bat also
in those countries which anticipated the
United Slates in its adoption, for it was
Benjamin Pranklm who Iirst conceited
the idea.
On an early morning walk along the
Etreels of Imdou in 17.S4 the thought Iirst
came to him, and in passing if on to the
world at large he said:
''In a walk through the Strand and Tit et
ttrect one morning at 7 o'clock I ob.-Ttcd
then; was not one shop open, although
it had been davlight ami the sun up
above three hours, the inhabitants of
lxndon choo.-iug voluntarily to live by
candle light and sleei by sun-bine; and
yet often complaining :t little absurdly of
the dnty on candles and the high price
of tallow.''
Soon thereafter in the Jtwrnal Je
Faris he publL-hcd an article, later ap
pearing among his es-ays under the title
4An Economical Project," which further
elaborated the advantages of daylight sav
ing; namely, of "Turning the clock for
ward an hour" so that everybody would
live one hour longer by davlight and one
hour less by artificial light.
Beaten Repeatedly in Britain.
Tor many years in England in the
last century Sir William Willctt annually
introduced his davlight sating bill in Par
liament and annually the bill wa- de
feated amid laughter and ridicule.
In 1915 Germany tirst adopted the plan
to speed np the war production and io
benefit by the tremendous saving in fuel
consumption. France and England and
nil other European countries except Rus
sia soon alter followed her example.
Since its adoption in Europe, the.
United State.-, Canada and Mexico have
been out of harmony, so far as time was
concerned, with European countries, to
their loss not only in business, for the
stock exchanges of Ixindon and Paris un
der the new plan were closed before the
exchanges of New York and I tost on were
open, but also as regards the tremendous
savings pos-ible in light bills, which, it
is estimated, annually will run from V0,
000,000 to $50,000,000 in the United
Sfates alone.
The plan has been ardently advocated
in this country since May, Wlfi, by the
Merchants Association of this city, cham
bers of commerce of Boston, Rochester,
Philadelphia, Chicago and Pittsburg, the
United States Chamber of Commerce,
Washington, D. C, and the National Day
light Saving Association, of which Marcus
M. Marks, former Borough President of
Manhattan, is the president. Mr. Marks
has often been called the '"'father of day
light saving in this country."
To illustrate the effect of the. plan, let
us follow Jack Hurryup, a New York
commuter, through his first business day
under the new regime.
Mr. Hurryup is a habitual reader of
The Scn, and accordingly he knows he
should on the evening of March 30 turn
his watch and clocks ahrad one hour be
fore he retires at 9 o'clock. But on the
night of Easter Sunday he goes through
the house from the kitchen to the
roof and advances each clock one hour
and is surprised when he arritis iu his
bed chamber and looks at his watch to
lind that he is retiring at 10:1.1 instead
of i:15 his lirst shock from daylight
saving.
The alarm dock rings louder than
usual the next morning and he. jumps out
that several of his friends to whom he
telephones have not yet arrived at the
office, but are expected auy minntt.
At 1 o'clock, his usual hour, he hurries
to the restaurant for luncheon and finds
a slim crowd. Upon returning to the of
fice all is running smoothly and at quar
ter of 5 he closes his desk to catch the
5:15. As he passes through the gate at
the Grand Central he sees the same fa
miliar crowd starting on their nightly
journey home.
Ed, Kill and Dick are on hand for the
nightly game of poker, .lack and his
friend Ed were the losers in the game,
for they spent most of their time joking
Bill and Dick for being April fools aud
having missed the train in the morning.
Alighting from the commuters' special
in the country, he is happily pleased to
note that it has not vet begun to grow

Noted American philosopher is the father of daylight saving.
of bed at C:.'J0, leans out of the window
and noles that the sun is ju-t ri-ing, and
then realizes that he is really getting up
one hour earlier by the sun, although the
alarm went off at the usual hour.
He rushes through his bath and his
breakfast and runs for the train. When
he arrives at the station he is surprised to
find many of his pals missing. The train
pulls in and he runs to his customary scat
in the smoker: the table and the cards
are there, but only one plajcr besides
himself. He greets Ed .(ones, who
boarded the train at the station, above
with:
"Good April fool joke on Bill and
Dick! Guess they forgot to turn their
watches ahead last night. We'll have
some sport with them to-morrow."
Mr. Hurryup piles into the subway
aud is astonished to lind a seat at the
Grand Central, his second shock from
the daylight saving. "Guess a lot of peo
ple are fooled by this daylight saving
this morning," he mutters to himself.
He arrives at the office, looks at the
clock to see whether he has consumed the
usual time on his journey down town and
is surprised to find that he is arriving
at 8:1.1, the exact time at which he took
the tram at his station. Shock No. 3.
No oflice boy in sight. He rings for his
stenographer and she greets him with a
hearty "Good morning He tells her
to get the porter immediately and turn
that oflice clock ahead one hour.
He finds no mail on his desk and con
cludes that the letter carrier is also one of
the daylight saving April fo;Is.
The morning runs on as usual except
dark and that the sun is still shining
brightly at 0 o'clock. "We fooled ton to
day. Old Sol, and will keep fooling you
until November 1," he says to himself.
Arriving at the house he goes to the
cellar, and finding that he need not turn
on the lights he gels out the lawn mower
and bis garden tools.
"This daylight sating is all right," he
calls up fo Mary; ''don't hurry to get on
the dinner. I am going to mow the lawn
and wotk in the garden until sundown."
After an hour's work about the grounds
.lack comes in to dinner and he anil Mary
agree that daylight saving is the greatest
boon ever conferred upon New York com
muters. The chief benefits of the plan, as
proved by the experience of England,
France and other European countries
where it has been in force, may be gen
erally summarized under three heads:
Eirst General health of all people
benefited by reason of an added hour of
daylight in the late afternoon, which has
been and will be u-ed for outdoor recre
ation and exercise.
Second Increased production of food
stuffs through the stimulating cultivation
of home gardening.
Third Money saved in lighting bills:
each householder will burn artificial light
one hour less each day, provided, of
course, he continues his usual habits of
retiring at night.
The report of the summertime commit
tee appointed by the British Parliament
in September, 1!1G, to inquire into the
social and economic results of the sum
mertime act shows that the extra hour of
dat light was generally ucd for the pur-po-e
of outdoor recreation and pursuit's,
and, in particular, for the cultivation of
home gardening.
The athletic dubs reported that the
cricketers, bowlers, golfers and tennii
players took full advantage of the extra
hour of light, and swimming pools and
playgrounds were utilized to full capac
ity. Iu view of the national agitation last
year, which is being renewed now, for
the cultivation of home gardens to in
crease the production of food the inaugu
ration of the daylight saving plan iu this
country will undoubtedly very greatly
stimulate home gardening, particularly in
the neighborhood of the great cities. In
New York city alone there are 1,000.000
daily commuters. Should only one-half
of them use the extra hour of daylight
which the plan will give in cultivating
home gardens there will bo 3,000,000 extra
hours utilized weekly in gardening and
during the seven summer months in which
the plan is in operation 2,000,000 days of
extra work and time will be spent by
these 500,000 commuters in the cultiva
tion of gardens.
What It Means in Potatoes.
It has been estimated that if the av
erage commuter wpre to work a plot of
land only 20x-10 feet, which would le
about I-50lh of an acre, and planted it all
to potatoes, on the basis of 300 bushels
per acre each commuter would he able
to rai-e from four to live bushels of pota
toes; on this basis half of the commuters
of New York city would add to the potato
crop during 191S approximately 2,500,
0011 bushels.
The saving in lighting bills ami in fuel
u.-ed for producing electricity and gas
wdl be tremendous. Public Service En
gineer Robert L. Bruuct of Providence,
If. I., has carefully estimated this saving
and fixed the amount during the period of
live mouths, which the plan originally
contemplated, at $-10,000,000, and tiie
amount of coal sated at 1,000,000 tons.
This sating will he unitersal as every
hou-eholder will u-e one hour les- of aili
licial light daily under the new plan.
Other additional benefits will be the re
duction of traffic accidents due to Ici-cncd
tran-poriation of pa'.sengers under arti
ficial light, reduction of the danger of eye
strain on account of the lessened amount
of reading and work done under artiticial
light and more lime for open air military
drilling.
The davlight sating hill as signed by
President Wilson on March 19 provides
lhat the plan shall go into effect at 2
o'clock antemeridian time on Sunday
morning, March 31, at which time clocks
and watches, probably upon a signal
flashed from the United States Naval
Observatory at Washington will be
turned ahead one hour. Comparatively
very few individuals, unless by design,
will be conscious w hen the change is
made. "This hour was selected by reason
of the fact that at 2 o'clock in the morn
ing the number of railroad trains actually
en route is smallest,
Nobody Will Be Inconvenienced.
Nobody will be seriously inconte
ilienced, unless on Easter Sunday morn
ing or on the night previous individuals
forget to turn their clocks and watches
forward an hour, as the result of which
omission they may find at some time dur
ing that daj- that they arc one hour be
hind the rest of the country.
The remarkable thing about the effect
of the movement is that practically no
class of business will be injured; the only
exception is the open air moving picture
exhibitors-, who under the new plan will
be. unable on account of the sun's setting
an hour later to begin their performance
as early as they have been accustomed in
previous years, which may result in a
loss of patronage. The ordinary business
man, as far as bis business is concerned,
will not be affected in the slightest, ex
cept that he will be more often tempted
this summer to go to the baseball game
which will begin at -1:30 o'clock instead
of 3:30 and to run down more often to
the beaches for a dip before dinner.
Everybody under the new regime will
continue his old habits rising, working,
dining and retiring at the same hours;
we will still live by the clocks and give
the laugh to the cob.</text>

These charts show vividly how the daylight saving plan will give j
everybody more "free hour#" of daylight. You've heard this: "Well,!
there are just so many hours of daylight in a day and you can't change j
'em." But wait?the daylight hours before your work-day itarts are
so-called "wasted hours"?you ?leep them away or spend them getting
ready to go to work. The daylight saving plan merely "shifts" an
hour of daylight to the "free hours" after work, when you can use it.
The tables is based on the average June day and the workday from
8 to 5 includes an hour for lunch.
Moving the Clock.
The clock will be set forward one
hour at 2 a. m., March SI, according
to the House bill. At the same hour
on October 27, the clock will be set
back.
The present standard time rones
will remain in effect.
Both changes will take place on
Sunday mornings so that the least
possible wrench may be given to
the industrial fabric of the nation.
But even at that on the railroads
alone there will be some 1.000 pas
senger trains and 5.000 trains run
ning on the tracks when the change
comes, and 1,698.SIS railroad clocks

J Congress will take up the consid

ownership or control of the packing j
industry before the present session
ends, according to all indications yes- j
terday. Information has been receiv
ed by members of the Senate to the
effect that the Federal Trade Com- j
mission is to make recommendations
for government ownership of the
packing industry. It is understood
that these recommendations will be
made at the conclusion of the pres
ent investigation which the Federal
Trade Commission is conducting.
Henry Veeder, general counsel for
Swift Co., yesterday filed a pro
test with Vice President Marshall,
Speaker Clark and other leaders in
Congress against the proposed
amendment to the search warrant
law recently requested by Francis J.
Heney, special investigator for the
Federal Trade Commission. The pur
pose of the amendments, the pro
test sets forth, is to legalise such
raids as that recently undertaken by
Heney at the offices of Mr. Veeder
in Chicago. It would make conclu
sive, the protest declares, the de
cision of a district judge issuing the
search warrant, and bars all appeals
until the purpose of the seizure has
been accomplished.
Veeder points out that (he Circuit
Court of Appeals, in his^ ease, held
void the search warrant under which
his office was raided, yet if the dis
trict judge's decision had been final,
as proposed by the Heney amendment.
Veeder would have been despoiled of
his papers without redress.
He suggests that if some agent of
the Comptroller of the Currency were
to assert In an illegal affidavit and
deposition that the money in the larg
est banks in Chicago and New York
was used as a means for the commls
sion of various felonies, such as im
proper speculation or attempted brib
ery of a bank examiner, a district
judge, under the proposed amend
ment, could issue a warrant for the
seizure of all the money in the bank
vaults, holding that "probable cause"
had been found. Thu*, without
chance of appeal, a government offi
cial and a district Judge could disrupt
banking operations of the entire coun
i try for months while even the Su
preme Court of the United States
i would stand powerles* to give relief
until after trial of the accused bank
officers.

to be fixed by order of the Inter
state Commerce Commission. But it
Is directed in the bill to have "due

ho like to leave the offices for a
alk. a little fishing trip nnd a round
f golf—to-day praised the passage 1
t the daylight-saving bill by Con- j
ress.
Physicians here to-day also were j
f the opinion that tho new sched- j
le. to become effective Easter Sun
ay, will do much for thd healUi j
fa great number of workers who'
or the first time will have a chance
3 get out into the parks and fields,
fter a day's work.
Businessmen generally tli rough-
out the city this afternoon declared
that the changing of hours would
be accomplished without interrupt
ing or hurting trade. It was said
that tho change would mean little
or nothing to the larger mills ahd
munitions plants, where three shifts
of men now ure engaged in working
throughout the twenty-four hours, j
No difficulty will be experienced in
trolley car schedules, it was said at
the offices of the Harrisburg and
'cross-river traction companies and
the turning of the watch will do
the trick. i
Theaters, railroads and every bus-
iness house in the city will operate
according to the now schedule, and,
therefore, it was pointed out, there
can be 110 confusion after a man
has once reset his watch.
Summed up, Mr, Littlefleld says:
"The bill provides tor an hour
advance in standard time at 2
o'clock a. in. on the last Sunday
in .March of each yefcr and at
a. m. the lust Sunday in October
uie standard time shall be retarded
one hour. Eleven countries have
adopted the summer daylight sav-
ing plan. The first was Germany,
then Great Britain, France, Austria-
Hungary, Italy, Sweden, Denmark,
Norway, Holland, Portugal and Au-/
stralla. London, England, saved
200,000 tons of coal during a sum
mer. In England in five and one
half months $12,000,000 in coal '.vere
saved, and In France $10,000,000. It
is estimated that in the United States
$10,000,000 can be saved in light
bills. The hour of daylight con
served by the proposed law can be
used by industrial workers throug
out America for gardening and agri
cultural work. This will be a most
important gain. We are sure of a
great shortage in farm labor this
summer and something must be done
to offset the probable loss in pro
duction of farm products. The hour
saved for daylight every day in April.
May, June, July, August, September
and October will be of inestimable
value in stimulating the dwellers in
cities and towns to interest them
selves in the production of garden
truck."PASS DAYLIGHT
SAVING BILL;
AWAITS WILSON
Clocks All Over Country Will
Be Turned Ahead
One Hour
Wusliington, Mar. 16—The House
of Representatives, by 252 to 40. yes
terday passed the Senate daylight
saving bill, under the terms of
which, when it receives the signa
ture of President Wilson, it'will be
required that all the clocks in the
United States be turned ahead one
hour at 2 a. m. 011 Sunday, March
31, and remain advanced one hour
until 2 a. m. on the last Sunday in
October.
Under the bill parsed by the
Senate the limit was, fixed as the
last Sunday in September. The
House amendment extending the
daylight saving one month was
adopted upon representations by-
Fuel Administrator Garfield that a
great amount of l'uel would be con
served thereby. It is expected that
the Senate will concur in the amend
ment to-morrow.
Five standard time zones for th
United States will be fixed by the
Government, according to the bill,
and it is made mandatory upon the
railroads to follow the standard
time.
By the passage of the bill, tho
United States joins with England,
France, Switzerland, Portugal and
the three Scandinavian countries in
adopting a method of economy and
efficiency first taken by Germany
during the early days of the war.
Millions of tons .of coal have been
saved in these countries, it was
stated to the House to-day by the
supporters of the measure, by the
simple means of turning the clock
ahead over a period of five or six
months a year.
England reports a saving of 12,-
000,000 tons up to date. Several
Representatives who espoused tha
bill admitted that when it was first
proposed they considered it silly.
But, they said, when they came to
examine its virtues they fell enthu
siastically behind it.
Provided the President signs it,
and there is little doubt that he will
do so quickly, the daylight-saving
bill will have the effect of turning
us all out of bed an hour earlier
than we have been accustomed-to
arise and of sending us back again
accordingly. The use of fuel at
night will be conserved by the clos
ing of establishments at 11 o'clock
which ordinarily do business until
12 o'clock. By the clock on the wall
it will still be 12 o'clock, but by
the moral conviction it. will be 11.
Officials of the Chamber of Com
merce and the Bourse, two of the
many local organisations which car
ried the light for the daylight-sav
ing bill into the very halls of Con
fess. were jubilant on receipt of
the news that the legislation was
so near. Ernest T. Trigg, president
of the Chamber of Commerce, said:
"This is very gratifying to us. By
a readjusting of working hours the
war industries will be speeded up
materially and more time for the
cultivation of war gardens will re
sult."
Emil P. Albrecht, president of the
Bourse, said:
"This legislation will enable work
ers to get better results out of their
daily efforts, as they will be in bet
ter tune for speeding up operations
in the early daylight hours of the
summer months. In such a large
manufacturing center as Philadel
phia the gain in efficiency in the
various war work lines will be tre
mendous. Only on Monday last the
directors of the Bourse urged upon
Congress for the second time within
two months the necessity for this
change."</text>
